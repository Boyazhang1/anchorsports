# Anchor Sports Website Revamp Project (in progress) 

### Business Problem 
Anchor Sports Club is a sports academy in Oakville dedicated to fostering a lifelong passion for sports in youth. More than 400 adolescents from Oakville take part in various training classes the club offers every week. Currently, their website is built with [Square's online store builder](https://squareup.com/ca/en/online-store), which offers limited flexibility in website design, and does not support the ability to add custom features the Anchor Sports owner desires. The owner has stated that current painpoints are
* Parents are unable to register for programs, and thus the owner must manually keep track of all registrations and payments manually via an excel spreadsheet
* The owners are unable to create the frontend user interface they desire
* The website cannot effectively display mandarin chinese and english, which is critical since 50% of the parents are recent immigrants from Mainland China
* The owners spend the majority of their working hours dealing with parent's requests through text messages, manually keeping track of student attendance and payment from parents. They are looking for a way to automate this through software.

Ultimately, the owners would like to extend the website into a student management system that tackles the aformentioned painpoints. 


### Solution
I decided to help tackle these challenges through a custom web-based application. This repo contains the mobile responsive website redesign for Anchor Sports Club built with Next.js, Typescript and TailwindCSS. The backend is hosted a seperate repo, and cannot be made public due to sensitive business logic.  

Currently building (frontend)
 - Reusable Typescript + React component
 - The signup/login flow for parents
